# Smart-Greenhouse
Smart Greenhouse  A graduate project was prepared and delivered by the Python programming language, PeyPlay mini computer, temperature sensor, gas sensor and ventilation fan. The project is still underway and is being registered as a patent in Iran.  This design was designed, implemented and implemented by Ali Dehghan Chaharabi and Alireza Amini for the first time in the format in Iran.

This project is written in Python.
For the graphic part, the Python version of the lobby itself is quite simple.
In this project, instead of using databases, nudepad files are used to simplify and make sense in the presentation of a master's degree.

You can make any comments, change the code with the source code and use it.

best regards,
Ali Dehghan Chaharabi
